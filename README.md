# Inventory Manager


Inventory Manager is a React project for my software engineering course at Flatiron School. As title says, users can manage **(Create, Read, Update, Delete)** their inventories regardless of stock types. Additional features include searching particular item by stock ID or filtering stocks by its type or supplier.

## Motivation
This is my second software engineering project at Flatiron School. Throughout this project, I was able to understand the basic part of wep applications such as process of UI transformation in the browser, web app platform structure and how JavaScript can become flexible with a remarkable library, React. 



## Application Features
- A dropdown menu on right upper corner `I want to: [Please Select]` where users can select options to create, edit, delete inventory.

- Search / Filter bar where users can search particular stock by its ID or filter stocks by its type or supplier.

- Click the Stock Image to view its detail.
