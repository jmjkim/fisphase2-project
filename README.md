# Inventory Manager

Inventory Manager is a React project (Single Page Application) for my software engineering course at Flatiron School. As title says, users can manage **(Create, Read, Update, Delete)** their inventories regardless of stock types. Additional features include searching particular item by stock ID or filtering stocks by its type or supplier.
